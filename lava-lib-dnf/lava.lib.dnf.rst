Lava - Dynamic Neural Fields
============================

Lava-DNF is a library within the Lava software framework. It provides
Lava Processes and other software infrastructure to build architectures
composed of Dynamic Neural Fields (DNFs). In particular, it provides
functions to generate connectivity patterns common to DNF architectures.

DNFs are neural attractor networks that generate
stabilized activity patterns in recurrently connected populations of neurons.
These activity patterns form the basis of neural representations, decision
making, working memory, and learning.
