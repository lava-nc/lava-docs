Developer Guide
###############
Welcome to the Lava Developers Guide! Lava is an open-source software framework and community for developing neuro-inspired applications and mapping them to neuromorphic hardware.

Lava is an open, community-developed code base. 

The purpose of this document is to provide a guide for contributing to Lava and explain how the Lava Project operates. The Lava Project can only grow through the contributions and work of this community. 

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Lava!

Lava's Origins
**************
The initial code for the Lava project (`github.com/lava-nc <https://github.com/lava-nc>`_) was seeded by Intel's Neuromorphic Computing Lab (NCL), a group within Intel Labs. NCL researchers continue to actively manage and expand the functionality of Lava, with the goal of building an active community of contributors and users.

Coding Conventions
******************

Code Requirements
=================
- Code must be **styled** according to `PEP8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_.

  - Line limit is 80 characters
  - Use short descriptive variable & function names

- Code must use **docstrings**:

  - module docstring
  - class docstring
  - method docstring
  - See :ref:`docsting format<Docsting Format>`

- Code should be developed using TDD (Test Driven Development)

  - Descriptive **unit tests** are *required*

    - Tests prove your code works
    - Tests help keep your code working when other contribute
    - Write descriptive unit tests that explain the intent of the test
    - Write minimal unit tests for just the feature you want to test

  - Unit tests must cover the code in each pull request

- All continuous integration checks must **pass** before pull requests are merged
- Code must be reviewed twice and merged by a :ref:`committer`

Guidelines
==========
- Before you embark on a big coding project, document it with an :ref:`issue <Open an Issue>` and discuss it with others including Lava Committers.
- Use consistent :ref:`numpy docstring format<Docsting Format>`
- Strive for a 100% linter score
- Prefer short yet descriptive variable and function names
- The more global a variable or function name the longer it may be. The more local the shorter the name should be
- When something breaks, many tests may fail. But don't be overwhelmed. Fix the lowest level unit tests first. Chances are good these will also fix higher level unit tests.
- Document everything

  - module doc string
  - class doc string
  - method docstring

Docsting Format
===============

.. code-block:: python

   # Use numpy-style docstring formatting: https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html#docstring-standard
   def function(self, arg1, arg2):
   """ <Short description>
   <Optional: Detailed description>

   Parameters
   ----------
   arg1
   arg2

   Returns
   -------

   """
