Application examples
--------------------

These are standalone tutorials that can be followed in any order.

**Coming soon:**

* Liquid state machine: Another classical canonical example in neuromorphic computing, illustrating a complex, spiking and recurrent neural network for time series classification.

* Learning: Many neuromorphic architectures offer local on-chip learning via bio-inspired STDP learning. This tutorial provides a simple example how such learning rules can be used.
